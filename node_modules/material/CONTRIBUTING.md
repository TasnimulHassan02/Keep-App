# Contributing to Material

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Material! This document provides guidelines and information about our development workflow.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.14.0 or Bun
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/alkaloid/material.git
cd material

# Install dependencies
bun install
# or
npm install
```

## Code Style

We use [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) style guide with ESLint for code quality and consistency.

### Linting

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes linting:

```bash
# Check for linting errors
bun run lint

# Auto-fix linting errors (when possible)
bun run lint:fix
```

We use [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) which comes bundled with ESLint and requires no configuration.

### Code Style Rules

- **No semicolons** - Standard JS style
- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Space before function parentheses** - `function foo () {}`
- **Object spacing** - `{ foo: 'bar' }`
- **No trailing whitespace**
- **LF line endings** (Unix style)
- **Final newline** in all files

### EditorConfig

We use `.editorconfig` for consistent code style across different editors. Most modern editors (including Zed, VSCode, Sublime Text) support it automatically.

### Standard JS

Standard JS is configured in `package.json` with project-specific globals. It includes ESLint internally, so no separate ESLint config is needed.

## Browser Compatibility

Material is designed for modern browsers with ES6+ support:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests (when available)
bun test
```

## Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `master`
2. Make your changes
3. Run linting: `bun run lint:fix` (Standard JS will auto-fix most issues)
4. Commit with descriptive messages
5. Push and create a merge request

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format when possible:
- `feat: add new component`
- `fix: resolve issue with dialog`
- `refactor: simplify event handling`
- `docs: update README`
- `style: fix linting issues`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Update documentation if needed
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Provide clear description of changes
- Reference related issues
